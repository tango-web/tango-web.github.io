The instrumental music features a string section playing an ascending long-note melody while at the same time providing harmonic support. A harp is playing arpeggios. Although it feels as if time passes slowly, the tempo is medium. Listening to this music I get a sense of profoundness that's moving me. This music could work well as the soundtrack for a movie.
