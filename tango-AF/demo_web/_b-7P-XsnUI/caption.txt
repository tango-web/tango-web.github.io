This is a classical music waltz piece played on a glass harp instrument. The melody is being played on the smaller glasses at a higher pitch while the rhythm is being played on the bigger glass at a medium pitch. The piece is being played at a cathedral which gives a nice resonance and natural reverb effect. The piece has a unique character. It can be played in the soundtracks of children's movies/TV shows.
