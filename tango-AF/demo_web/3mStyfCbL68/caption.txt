The drum is playing a four on the floor groove with little fill-ins on the snare crash. A synthesizer is playing a 2000s pad sounding lead melody. The distorted e-guitar that is playing underlining the melody with some long sounding chords. This song may be played at an event to animate and pump up the people.
